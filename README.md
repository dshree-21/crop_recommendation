The agriculture industry is one of the mainstays of the Indian economy and contributes significantly to the country's GDP. However, the farming community faces several challenges that hinder growth, including the lack of access to modern technology and accurate information about soil conditions. To overcome these challenges, our project focused on developing a crop recommendation system that takes into account various soil parameters important for agriculture.

Our project aimed to provide farmers with recommendations for crops that are well-suited for their particular region based on the unique soil characteristics. The system considers different parameters such as soil texture, pH level, nutrient content, and moisture levels to make personalized recommendations. By analyzing the soil features of four different regions in India. We were able to develop a comprehensive dataset of crop recommendations that can help farmers increase yield and profitability.
